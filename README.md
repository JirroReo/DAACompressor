## DAA Compressor Program
===========

###  Architecture

This project is built using these libraries/softwares:

- [Java Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) as the frontend GUI library
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) as the backend code for algorithms

### Structure

Important folders/file in this project:

- `build/` : Anything related to the built `.jar`s should be found here
- `nbproject/` : Configuration files for the GUI
- `src/` : Contains all of the algorithms
- `src/CGZipCompressor/` : This is where the files for GZIP algorithm live
- `src/CHuffmanCompressor/` : Contains the folders related to Huffman Algorithm
- `src/CLZWCompressor/` : This is where the files for ZLW algorithm are
- `src/CRLECompressor/` : The files for RLE algorithm can be found here
